Open command prompt
Move to the folder you want to save the project files in my case it is desktop so I run
```
cd desktop
```
Then run
```
git clone https://github.com/Sethee-IT-LTD/igowithigho-art-sale.git
```
Then open up the igowithigho folder by running
```
cd igowithigho-art-sale.git
```
Then you need to install node modules by running
```
npm i
or
yarn
```
When the process is successful run
```
npm run dev
or
yarn dev
```
